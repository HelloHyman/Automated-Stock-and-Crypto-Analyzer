## üõ†Ô∏è For Developers (Building the Executable)

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Build Instructions

#### Option 1: Automated Build (Recommended)
1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd path\to\Stock_Profile\RedPanda
   ```
3. Run the build script (either one):
   ```bash
   BUILD.bat
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   WindowsBuild\build_windows.bat
   ```
4. Wait for the build to complete
5. Find your executable at: `WindowsBuild\dist\StockAnalyzer.exe`

#### Option 2: Manual Build
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r WindowsBuild\requirements.txt
   ```
2. Navigate to WindowsBuild folder and build:
   ```bash
   cd WindowsBuild
   pyinstaller --clean stock_analyzer.spec
   cd ..
   ```
3. Find your executable at: `WindowsBuild\dist\StockAnalyzer.exe`

### Distribution
After building, you can distribute the `StockAnalyzer.exe` file to anyone with Windows.
The executable is self-contained and includes all dependencies.

**File size:** Approximately 100-150 MB (includes Python runtime and all libraries)

### Optional: Add an Icon
1. Create or download an `.ico` file for your application
2. Save it as `icon.ico` in the WindowsBuild directory
3. Edit `WindowsBuild\stock_analyzer.spec` and change:
   ```python
   icon=None,
   ```
   to:
   ```python
   icon='icon.ico',
   ```
4. Rebuild the executable

### Troubleshooting

#### Build Fails
- **Error: "Python not found"**
  - Ensure Python is installed and added to PATH
  - Reinstall Python with "Add to PATH" option checked

- **Error: "Module not found"**
  - Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - Ensure you're using the correct Python environment

#### Runtime Issues
- **"Failed to execute script"**
  - Build with console enabled for debugging:
    - Edit `stock_analyzer.spec`: change `console=False` to `console=True`
    - Rebuild to see error messages

- **Antivirus blocking the .exe**
  - This is common with PyInstaller executables
  - Add an exception in your antivirus software
  - Consider code signing the executable (requires certificate)

### Advanced Configuration

#### Reduce File Size
Edit `stock_analyzer.spec`:
- Change `upx=True` to enable UPX compression (if installed)
- Add excludes for unused modules

#### Single Folder vs Single File
Current configuration creates a single .exe file (easier to distribute).
For faster startup, you can create a folder-based distribution:
- Change `a.binaries` collection method in the spec file
